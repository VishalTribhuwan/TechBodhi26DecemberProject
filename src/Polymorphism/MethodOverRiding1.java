// Method OverRidding:-

// If in a child(sub) class method with the same name as a parent class but specific implementation Eg:- Honda Car Engine, Maruti Care Engine

// Its applicable on only methods not on variables

// PolicyBazar eg is also for MethodOverRiding.....RBI Banks provides Specific implementation of ROI

// Same name

// Different class

// Same Arguments:- 1) No of Argmnts  2) Types of Argmnts  3) Sequence of Argmnts

// If we satisfied above 3 conditions bt there is no Inheritence then this is not Method Overiding 

// Inheritance ka different classes me relationship hona chahhiye toh Method Overriding successfull hoga
